1. The & means that it is a reference variable. Its calling the object by reference and placing it into the array. 
2. You have to set the stats for each individual seperatly because some are offense and some are defense, using a loop wouldn't be able to set both at the same time. 
3. #ifndef means if the class is not define already the #define ( define it now). #endif means its the end of the class. 
4. Because its private, no where else in the code can it be accessed by any other class other than its own. I had to create two seperate strings for offense and defense. 
5. They are protected because then they can still be inherited by the other two class, while still having limitations on what can be changed with them. 
Unlike private, where its not inherited and can't be accessed by any other class. 
6. Its the default value for minutes. 
7. Const means that a function can not modify any values or parameters. Its whole function is to display the values and not modify them. 
8. SetMethod because it is inheirted by both classes, and they don't need any modifications to setMethod class. 
9. An abstract class is like a base class used for other classes to inherit from. The abstract class is the player class.
10. One thing i remembered that i had forgotten is how inheritance works.
