The problem with the program was it had a Linker Error 2001 (Unresolved External Symbol). 
The function onNext was not defined in the DlgGuide.cpp file. It was closed off with comment brackets making it 
invisible to the compiler and linker. After I deleted the comment / that had enclosed the function, everything worked.
